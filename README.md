Did you know that a group of apes is called a shrewdness?
 - My most recent project is Shrewdness. This project spans 2 repositories, Shrewdness and ShrewdnessElectron, it is a full stack web application with a seperate Electron frontend that talks to the same backend as the web version. It is a group chatroom application with Websockets, AWS integration for media, autocomplete using a Trie Data Structure, Themes and more. I had a blast making it, and I would love for you to check it out!
